# üõ∞Ô∏è WiFightClub

**WiFightClub** is a lightweight, mildly sarcastic diagnostics logger that gathers Wi-Fi metrics and stores them in JSON logs and interactive dashboards.

---

## üß© What It Does

This tool periodically collects a snapshot of local Wi-Fi and network conditions and saves it to disk. Over time, it builds a time-series dataset that can be visualized to show:

- Wi-Fi signal strength (RSSI)
- Packet loss %
- Average latency to 8.8.8.8
- Transmit rate (Mbps)
- Noise level (dBm)
- Disconnect/system log events (macOS only, optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è What It Collects

### üì∂ `wifi_stats`  
Gathered via `wdutil info` (on macOS), parsed using regex.

- `ssid` ‚Äì network name
- `rssi` ‚Äì signal strength in dBm (e.g. -60)
- `tx_rate` ‚Äì theoretical max transmit rate (Mbps)
- `noise` ‚Äì ambient Wi-Fi noise in dBm
- `channel` ‚Äì the frequency and bandwidth used

### üåê `ping_stats`  
Runs `ping -c 100 -i 0.1 8.8.8.8` and parses summary.

- `packet_loss_percent` ‚Äì % of dropped packets
- `avg_latency_ms` ‚Äì average ping latency (ms)


---


## üîÅ Continuous Monitoring

To run this automatically every 5 minutes:

```bash
python3 monitor/run_monitor.py
```

This will:
- Collect fresh diagnostics
- Archive logs older than 7 days
- Re-generate all plots
- (Optionally) push updates to GitHub

Make sure `.env` is set up with:
```env
REPO_URL=git@github.com:your/repo.git
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_yourTokenHere
```

---

## üì¶ Archiving Data

Logs are saved in `data/` and rotated to `archive/` based on retention rules. To archive manually:

```bash
zip archive/test_data_2025-06-21.zip data/log_*.json
rm data/log_*.json
```

You can copy that ZIP to a new host and let it continue collecting.

## üßº Resetting

Need to reset plots or start fresh?

```bash
rm data/*.json
rm docs/*.html
python3 visualizer/plot.py
```
